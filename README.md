# Dissertation Code
This repository contains various R scripts used in the processing and analysis of data for my dissertation, titled "Coexistence, Ecomorphology, and Diversification in the Avian Family Picidae (Woodpeckers and Allies)".

Each .R file contains a set of functions and scripts used for a portion of the dissertation. Some of the scripts depend on objects created and saved in other scripts; these are documented in the code annotation.

Useful functions from these scripts are being bundled into several R packages which will be made available in other repositories. I will provide links here when these are completed.
